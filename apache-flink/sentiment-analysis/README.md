# Sentiment Analysis using Apache Flink

![](img/flink.gif)

This project runs a Sentiment Analysis application with [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) Stream API.

You can interactively type in sentences to simulate stream data,
and Flink will process and show the result in the terminal.

## Step to run

Firstly you need to create a simple text server by doing the following in the terminal:

### Linux/Mac

```
nc -l 9000
```

### Windows

```
nc -l -p 9000
```

After that you can open another terminal in the project and run the follows:

```
./gradlew run
```

On Windows use `gradlew.bat` instead.

Try to type in anything from your text server:

```
$ nc -l 9000
I love you!
```

result shows on Flink application:

```
