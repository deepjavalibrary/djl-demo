# DJL Spark Image Classification Example

## Introduction
This folder contains two demo applications built with Spark and DJL to run a group image classification
task.

- ImageClassificationExample: Ready to run for classification using built in model in ModelZoo
- DataProcessExample: If you are new to DJL and would like to learn more on the processing logic. (PyTorch Engine only)

You can also look at the Spark3.0 version of this demo [here](../spark3.0/image).

## Setup

We provide two options to build, you can choose to build with `sbt` or `gradle`.

We use PyTorch engine by default, you can switch to MXNet or TensorFlow Engine by adding these lines:

### sbt

#### MXNet
```
libraryDependencies += "ai.djl.mxnet" % "mxnet-model-zoo" % "0.10.0"
libraryDependencies += "ai.djl.mxnet" % "mxnet-native-auto" % "1.7.0-backport"
```

#### TensorFlow
```
libraryDependencies += "ai.djl.tensorflow" % "tensorflow-model-zoo" % "0.10.0"
libraryDependencies += "ai.djl.tensorflow" % "tensorflow-native-auto" % "2.3.1"
```

### gradle

You should add these in `dependencies`

#### MXNet
```
runtimeOnly "ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-model-zoo:0.10.0"
runtimeOnly "ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-backport"
```

#### TensorFlow
```
runtimeOnly "ai.djl.tensorflow:tensorflow-model-zoo:0.10.0"
runtimeOnly "ai.djl.tensorflow:tensorflow-native-auto:2.3.1"
```

Apart from that, you may also need to use `NaiveEngine` mode in MXNet for multi-thread inference.
Please add this line in your `SparkConf`

```
.setExecutorEnv("MXNET_ENGINE_TYPE", "NaiveEngine")
```

## Run the example

This example will run image classification with pretrained `resnet18` model on images in the `images` folder.
The output will be saved under `out/spark_output`.

This is the expected output from console:
```
