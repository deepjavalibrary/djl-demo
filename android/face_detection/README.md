# DJL Android Demo

# Introduction

In this example, you learn how to implement inference code with a pytorch model to detect faces in an image.

Lightweight model:
The model github can be found at [Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB](https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB).
