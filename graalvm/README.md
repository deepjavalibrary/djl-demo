# Run TensorFlow model on GraalVM

## Overview

[GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) is an alternative to HotSpot JVM that allows you to compile the application
code ahead of time (AOT) into a native execute.

This is an example to demonstrate how to use Deep Java Library to run a TensorFlow model on GraalVM.  

## Setup

Follows the [GraalVM installation instruction](https://www.graalvm.org/getting-started/#install-graalvm) to set up
GraalVM on your system. Make sure the `native-image` tool also gets installed:
- Configure $GRAALVM_HOME and $JAVA_HOME environment variable to the location you installed

    ```shell
    # for example:
    export $GRAALVM_HOME=/path/to/graalvm/
    export $JAVA_HOME=$GRAALVM_HOME
    ```
- [native-image](https://www.graalvm.org/getting-started/#native-images) is installed

    ```shell
    $GRAAL_HOME/bin/gu install native-image
    ```

## Build and run the application
Run the following command to build the project and run:

```shell
# set environment variable to suppress TensorFlow logging:
export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=1

./mvnw clean
./mvnw package exec:java

[
	class: "n04254680 soccer ball", probability: 0.92693
	class: "n04039381 racket, racquet", probability: 0.06132
	class: "n09835506 ballplayer, baseball player", probability: 0.01018
	class: "n04540053 volleyball", probability: 0.00068
	class: "n02799071 baseball", probability: 0.00026
]
```
   
## Build native image

Run the following command to build the native executable for this project:

```shell
# build native image with TensorFlow engine
./mvnw clean package -Pnative -Ptensorflow

# build native image with PyTorch engine
./mvnw clean package -Pnative -Ppytorch
```

You will find a native executable file generated: `target/image-classification`

# Run application

```shell
# set environment variable to suppress TensorFlow logging:
export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=1
target/image-classification
```
