- Python Hybrid mode (under development): User can offer a python script to do pre/post processing with a model file.
- Java mode: User need to prepare a Java pre/post processing script and a model file.
- Binary mode: User just need to prepare a model file, we will just run tensor-in, tensor out operation.
