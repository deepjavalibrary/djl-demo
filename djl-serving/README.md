# DJL Serving demo

In this folder, we will showcase the four popular operation modes in DJL Serving. There are four operating modes supported:

- [Python mode](python-mode/README.md): User just need to prepare a python script file to execute.
- Python Hybrid mode (under development): User can offer a python script to do pre/post processing with a model file.
- [Java mode](java-mode/README.md): User need to prepare a Java pre/post processing script and a model file.
- [Binary mode](binary-mode/README.md): User just need to prepare a model file, we will just run tensor-in, tensor out operation.
