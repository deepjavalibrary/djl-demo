## Low cost inference with AWS Inferentia

[AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/) is a high performance machine
learning inference chip, custom designed by AWS. Amazon EC2 Inf1 instances are powered by AWS
Inferentia chips, which provides you with the lowest cost per inference in the cloud and lower
the barriers for everyday developers to use machine learning (ML) at scale. Customers using models
such as YOLO v3 and YOLO v4 can get up to 1.85 times higher throughput and up to 40% lower cost per
inference compared to the EC2 G4 GPU-based instances.

In the demo, you will learn how to run PyTorch model with DJL on Amazon EC2 Inf1 instances.

## Setup environment

### Launch Inf1 EC2 instance
Please launch Inf1 instance by following the below steps:

- Please follow the instructions at [launch an Amazon EC2 Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-launch-instance)
  to Launch an Inf1 instance, when choosing the instance type at the EC2 console.
  Please make sure to select the correct instance type.
- When choosing an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) select [Deep Learning Base AMI, Ubuntu 18.04 Options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/ubuntu18-04.html)

### Install AWS Inferentia neuron SDK

The Inferentia neuron SDK is required for converting PyTorch pre-trained model into neuron traced model.

```
python3 -m venv myenv

source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install torchvision==0.9.1 torch-neuron==1.8.1.1.4.1.0 'neuron-cc[tensorflow]==1.4.1.0' --extra-index-url=https://pip.repos.neuron.amazonaws.com
```

After installing the Inferentia neuron SDK, you will find `libneuron_op.so` is installed in
`myenv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch_neuron/lib` folder.
You need configuration environment variable to enable Inferentia for DJL:

```
export PYTORCH_EXTRA_LIBRARY_PATH=$(python -m site | grep $VIRTUAL_ENV | awk -F"'" '{print $2}')/torch_neuron/lib/libneuron_op.so
```

## Compile your model into Neuron traced model

Use the following python script to trace a PyTorch resnet50 model. The script can also be found in the repo at [trace.py](https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl-demo/blob/master/aws/inferentia/trace.py).

```
import torch
import os
import torch_neuron
from torchvision import models
import logging

# Enable logging so we can see any important warnings
logger = logging.getLogger('Neuron')
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# An example input you would normally provide to your model's forward() method.
image = torch.zeros([1, 3, 224, 224], dtype=torch.float32)

# Load a pretrained ResNet50 model
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)

# Tell the model we are using it for evaluation (not training)
model.eval()

# Use torch.jit.trace to generate a torch.jit.ScriptModule via tracing.
djl_traced_model = torch.jit.trace(model, image)

# Save the Regular TorchScript model for benchmarking
os.makedirs("models/djl/resnet50", exist_ok=True)
djl_traced_model.save("models/djl/resnet50/resnet50.pt")

# Analyze the model - this will show operator support and operator count
torch.neuron.analyze_model(model, example_inputs=[image])

# Now compile the model - with logging set to "info" we will see
# what compiles for Neuron, and if there are any fallbacks
model_neuron = torch.neuron.trace(model, example_inputs=[image])

# Export to saved model
os.makedirs("models/inferentia/resnet50", exist_ok=True)
model_neuron.save("models/inferentia/resnet50/resnet5.pt")
print("Compile success")
```

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl-demo.git
cd djl-demo/aws/inferentia

python trace.py 
```

Execute above command, now you have a Neuron traced model ready for inference in 
`models/inferentia/resnet50` folder.

## Run example java program

```
cd djl-demo/aws/inferentia

./gradlew run
